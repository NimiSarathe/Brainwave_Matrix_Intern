This project was created for a Python programming internship. I used the following technologies to develop it:  

**Front-end:**  
- Tkinter for the desktop application  
- Flask for the web API  

**Back-end:**  
- Python  

To execute the code, run:  

```bash
python atm.py
```  

JSON will help you store and manage records.
